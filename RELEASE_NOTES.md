# Release Notes - 1.0.0-alpha.76

## "Autonomous Production Bridge" — Phase 4 Foundation

This release finalizes the bridge between a mock AI prototype and a production-ready autonomous agent machine. It integrates real search APIs, implements graceful persistence, and establishes mesh-wide observability for "Luxury Space Communism."

### New Core Features

- **Real Research Integration**: Live web search powered by the Tavily API (1.0.0-alpha.76). Graceful fallback to mock data if API key is missing.
- **Graceful Shutdown**: SIGINT/SIGTERM signal handling ensures system state (memory, ledger) is atomically persisted to disk on exit (1.0.0-alpha.76).
- **Federated Wealth Dashboard**: Real-time visualization of collective mesh profit and individual peer health ('Luxury Space Communism').
- **Space Communication Interface**: Interactive mesh management submenu for listing peers, broadcasting global directives, and syncing collective strategies.
- **Autonomous Agent Observability**: Real-time agent status and iteration logs visible on the Dashboard.
- **Content Library Viewer**: Browse generated blog posts, newsletters, and articles directly from the CLI.

### Integration Milestones

- **Phase 3/4 Bridge Complete**: Autonomous Agent Loops are now fully integrated with high-ROI Luxury Protocol operations.
- **LLM-Verified Healing**: The system now uses AI to verify if a proposed fix actually resolved a system instability.
- **Monorepo Sanitization**: All legacy submodules and merge markers have been removed.

### Production Readiness

- **Build System**: Streamlined `build.sh` for all 6 core modules.
- **CI/CD**: Explicit workspace testing for all modules.
- **Test Suite**: 100% pass rate with new content and healer coverage.
