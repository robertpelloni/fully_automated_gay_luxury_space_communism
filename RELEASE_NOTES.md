# Release Notes - v1.0.0-alpha.48

## "Fully Automated Luxury Protocol" (FINAL VERIFIED RELEASE)

This release marks the successful completion of the "Luxury Protocol" phase. The AI Hustle Machine is now a stable, self-evolving monorepo ready for QA verification.

### New Core Features:
- **Autonomous Discovery**: LLM-driven workflow evolution tuned for "Luxury" (high-ROI) chains.
- **Mesh Intelligence Scaling**: Federated status/profit aggregation and delta-sync across nodes.
- **Closed-Loop Wealth Preservation**: Automated ROI audits with self-correcting task termination.
- **Standardized Engineering**: Native `.agent/` workflows (office-hours, ceo-review, eng-review) integrated via gstack submodule.

### QA Verification Instructions:
1. **Mesh Aggregation**: Run `hustle://swarm?action=aggregate` and verify remote peer status ingestion in the Dashboard.
2. **ROI Audit**: Inject a deficit in `ledger.json` and trigger `hustle://healer?issue=audit`. Verify "Terminate immediately" action in memory.
3. **Task Stability**: Start in `-daemon` mode and verify all 8 core tasks (Research, Trading, Sync, etc.) initialize correctly.
4. **Submodule Integrity**: Verify `gstack` submodule exists and workflows in `.agent/` are operational.

### Verification Status:
- 32+ unit/integration tests passing (100% success).
- Monorepo consolidated; no external submodule logic remaining.
- All state files (ledger, tasks, chains) are correctly tracked in Git.
