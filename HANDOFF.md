# Session Handoff - v1.0.0-alpha.42

## Summary of Changes
1.  **Mesh Intelligence Scaling:** Implemented `hustle://swarm?action=aggregate` to gather mesh-wide status. The dashboard now visualizes remote peer profits and health.
2.  **Autonomous Luxury Protocol:** Refined `ChainDiscoverer` to focus on "Luxury" (high-yield, low-maintenance) workflows.
3.  **Wealth Preservation:** Added ROI auditing to the `Healer`. The system now detects underperforming hustles and logs corrective termination actions.
4.  **Toolchain:** Verified Go 1.24.3 consistency and successful system build.

## Project State
- **Stable Candidate:** v1.0.0-alpha.42
- **Key Modules:** All five core modules (Orchestrator, Research, Social, Curation, Trading) are active and networked via A2A.
- **Verification:** Integrated tests for Swarm Aggregation, Healer Loop, and Wealth Preservation are passing.

## Next Steps for Successor
1.  **Close the Loop:** Wire the `WealthPreservation` corrective actions (currently logged in L1) directly to the `Scheduler` to automatically stop underperforming tasks.
2.  **Cluster Testing:** Launch multiple orchestrator instances with the `-seed` flag to verify real-time mesh aggregation under load.
3.  **Refine Strategy:** Enhance the `Trading` module's "Algorithmic Confluence" with more indicators (MACD/Bollinger) now that the base concurrency is stable.
