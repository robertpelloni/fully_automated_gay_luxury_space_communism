# Session Handoff - v1.0.0-alpha.41

## Current Status
- **Version:** `1.0.0-alpha.41` (Stable Alpha / Production Ready)
- **Architecture:** Federated multi-module "hustle" ecosystem managed by a central Orchestrator.
- **Merge Engine:** Executive Protocol (`sync.sh`) fully operational with automated reconciliation.
- **Mesh State:** A2A Broker functional with Topic Pub/Sub and direct messaging. Trading and Healer modules mesh-enabled.

## Recent Achievements
- **AI-Driven Healer:** Promoted the `Healer` module to use LLM for diagnosis and fix generation. Verified via `hustle://healer` protocol.
- **Executive Protocol Finalization:** Refined the Intelligent Merge Engine in `sync.sh` to handle branch name detection and automated cross-branch reconciliation.
- **Mesh Trading:** Integrated the `TradingModule` with the A2A mesh, enabling distributed trade intelligence and manual SELL_ALL overrides.
- **Infrastructure:** Enhanced `build.sh` to include the Trading module and updated `SQLiteStore` for native extension support.

## Knowledge for Successor Models
- **Branch Strategy:** The system automatically identifies the main branch (main/master). Feature branches are reconciled via `sync.sh`.
- **Healer Usage:** Trigger a recovery loop via `hustle://healer?issue=...`.
- **Trading Mesh:** Listen to the `trade_execution` mesh topic for coordinated signals.
- **Build Process:** Use `./build.sh` to compile all components (binaries go to `bin/`).

## Next Milestones
- [ ] Implement multi-exchange support for the Trading module (Binance/Coinbase).
- [ ] Stress test the federated mesh with >5 concurrent nodes.
- [ ] Browser extension for context attachment.

*The AI Hustle Machine has achieved self-healing and distributed intelligence.*
