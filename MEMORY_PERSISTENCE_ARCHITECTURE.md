**Cozette is a 6x13px (bounding box; average 5px character width, 3px descent, 10px ascent, 8px cap height) bitmap font based on Dina, which itself is based on Proggy. It's also heavily inspired by Creep. The project aims to create a useful bitmap alternative to Nerd Fonts, focusing on glyph coverage and providing a nicer character map with codepoints. It offers three main variants: normal/hi-dpi bitmaps (.bdf, .otb, .psf, and .fnt) and vector fonts (.ttf).**

**Features:**
- The core innovation lies in its bitmap nature
- offering a specific set of glyphs optimized for terminal/CLI environments. It provides both bitmap formats (.otb) and vector formats (.ttf)
